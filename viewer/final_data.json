These are all Medium tracks, so she herself isn\u2019t very good on them, due to having Mile skills. On other final corner tracks, her unique typically triggers too early to do anything, but she can be inherited on Late Surgers/End Closers, who can pass into 5th to trigger it later and get the accel. On such tracks, Dober isn\u2019t a good inherit, so she can replace Dober as a parent. In Team Trials, she has consistent skills and a consistent unique, just don\u2019t evolve Accel Full Throttle. It requires first place when evolved, which isn\u2019t consistent even for Front Runner. Her inherited unique is also very consistent for all styles and can be inherited on anyone in Team Trials for points.",

Her evolved debuff gives her Current Speed which is quite potent if it triggers early, but she has to be 6th or below to trigger it, so it\u2019s not consistent. Her gold green is good for her signature track, Queen Elizabeth Cup. None of her kit is consistent for Team Trials. She\u2019s my favourite uma so let\u2019s just say she\u2019s a 5.",
